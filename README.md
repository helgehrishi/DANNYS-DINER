## Project Overview

The dataset consists of three main tables:

1. **Sales**: Records of customer transactions, including purchase dates and items.
2. **Menu**: Details of the available food items, including prices.
3. **Members**: Information about customers who have enrolled in Danny's membership program.

Using these tables, various SQL queries were written to address key business questions and provide actionable insights for the diner.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Total Amount Spent by Each Customer
This analysis calculates the total spending of each customer based on their transactions at the diner. Understanding how much each customer spends can help tailor marketing strategies to encourage more spending or reward high-value customers.

### 2. Days Each Customer Visited the Restaurant
Identifying the number of distinct days a customer visited the restaurant helps assess customer frequency and loyalty. This metric is key to understanding diner traffic patterns and customer engagement.

### 3. First Item Purchased by Each Customer
Knowing the first item purchased by customers can provide insights into menu preferences and help design targeted offers for new customers.

### 4. Most Purchased Item
This analysis determines the most popular item at Danny's Diner. It helps identify star products and informs decisions about promotions or expanding successful menu categories.

### 5. Most Popular Item for Each Customer
By looking at which item each customer purchases most frequently, Danny can better understand individual preferences and personalize offers to enhance customer loyalty.

### 6. First Item Purchased After Becoming a Member
This topic explores the first purchase made by each customer after enrolling in the membership program, which may reflect how membership impacts purchasing behavior.

### 7. Item Purchased Just Before Becoming a Member
Analyzing the items customers bought just before becoming members can provide insight into whether certain purchases trigger membership signups and guide marketing efforts accordingly.

### 8. Total Items and Amount Spent Before Becoming a Member
This analysis looks at how much customers spent before joining the membership program. Understanding pre-membership spending habits helps determine whether members are already loyal customers or if the membership drives increased engagement.

### 9. Points Calculation for Each Customer
This section calculates the total points earned by each customer based on their purchases, simulating a rewards program. It helps determine how customers can be incentivized through a points-based loyalty system.
